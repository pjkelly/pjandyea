  <h2>Bridesmaids</h2>
  <p class="intro">They say friends are your chosen family.  I have been lucky enough to have an amazing family and be spoiled enough to have a chosen family. These girls are my lifeline and without them, I would not be the person I am today.  They have taught me to love, laugh and cry, and to realize that well, life would be boring without them.  :)  I am honored to introduce my wonderful bridesmaids... <cite>- Yea</cite></p>
  <div class="people" id="elaine">
    <h3>Elaine Chen Emlinger - <em>Matron of Honor</em></h3>
    <img src="/images/ladies/elaine.jpg" src="Elaine Chen" />
    <p>First and foremost, she's my sister!  And I love her to death.  She has been my role model since I was old enough to remember.  I can't imagine anyone else standing right next to me on this big day.  We have been through so much together and I feel so lucky to have her.  She's taught me everything I know.  Also, I love eating NYC delivery Thai food with her.  That is special.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="people" id="marissa">
    <h3>Marissa Arciola - <em>Bridesmaid</em></h3>
    <img src="/images/ladies/marissa.jpg" src="Marissa Arciola" />
    <p>The girl stepped on my stomach, and is the only one to this day to have done so! If you lived in Rochester, you'd understand...all that black ice... If that's not love, I don't know what is!  Marissa is a loyal friend who lets me play and cheat on Duck Hunt for Nintendo in her apartment for hours at a time without kicking me out.  She also is the only person to give me a nickname with a silent Q.  Ask her if you're curious ;).  Marissa makes my cheeks hurt with laughter, and if you know me, you know how much I value that.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="people" id="minh">
    <h3>Minh Dao - <em>Bridesmaid</em></h3>
    <img src="/images/ladies/minh.jpg" src="Minh Dao" />
    <p>Minh has a liver of steel.  For that alone, I respect her a TON.  Besides the fact that we were perfect roommates and she made me food all the time when we still lived together.  She also has the longest name ever.  Minh Tram Nguyen Dao Chung.  She also lets me know when a bathroom is "Ah-coo-pod".  Classic.  I also almost killed her with my car, twice (once VERY recently), and she is still willing to be my friend.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="people" id="yuki">
    <h3>Yuki Numata - <em>Bridesmaid</em></h3>
    <img src="/images/ladies/yuki.jpg" src="Yuki Numata" />
    <p>Yuki is amazing in every way. She is an incredible violinist-and so humble it's unbelievable!!  I love how down to earth she is, and she really balances me out.  She didn't laugh at me for crying like a fool when she moved out a little early to move on with life.  In fact she hugged me and cried too. *tear*  She danced in my room and sang Christina Aguilera.  Kind of hard not to love this girl.  When I am near her, my temperature is 98 degrees and rising.   Don't be jealous PJ!</p>
  </div>
  <div class="people" id="jennifer">
    <h3>Jennifer Sabado - <em>Bridesmaid</em></h3>
    <img src="/images/ladies/jennifer.jpg" src="Jennifer Sabado" />
    <p>We met midway through high school and hit it off from the start.  I love Jen's signature fast talk and life without her would be boring.  She is an amazing friend who always tells me the truth, and understands me no matter how crazy I can sound.  I'd have apples with flavored olive oils any day with her.  :)  As crazy as that sounds-no you didn't read the sentence wrong.  Ask her...apples and olive oil...this is a GOOD thing.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="people" id="dara">
    <h3>Dara Sun - <em>Bridesmaid</em></h3>
    <img src="/images/ladies/dara.jpg" src="Dara Sun" />
    <p>I have known this girl over half my life and I'm so thankful and honored for that.  We have been through thick and thin together and we've survived it all-yes that also includes the gift/curse we bear for our liquid superpowers. I love that Dara isn't afraid to call me out on my BS and sticks through it with me.  That's how I know her willingness to stand up there with me on the wedding day should be taken as a good sign for my future with PJ</p>

<div class="section party" id="groomsmen">
  <h2>Groomsmen</h2>
  <p class="intro">The following gentlemen represent the best of the best in my life.  Aside from my dad, none have had more of an impact on me as a person, and the trajectory my life has taken thus far.  All have been there for me at critical points in my life, and I can only hope to repay them by being able to do the same for them.  It is a tremendous honor to have the six of them standing with me when Yea and I get married. <cite>- PJ</cite></p>
  <div class="people" id="ryan">
    <h3>Ryan Sabado - <em>Best Man</em></h3>
    <img src="/images/guys/ryan.jpg" src="Ryan Sabado" />
    <p>Ryan has played an important part in making the West Coast feel like home to me.  His food and wine sensibility are a constant source of enlightenment and good times.  Frequent wine tasting excursions, vacationing in Mexico, being a part of his and Jennifer's wedding day; our friendship has been an adventure, and will no doubt continue to be so.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="people" id="dave">
    <h3>Dave Castillo - <em>Groomsman</em></h3>
    <img src="/images/guys/dave.jpg" src="Dave Castillo" />
    <p>Someone who I can always count on to make me laugh, Dave has been an incredible friend to me (and Yea).  He is someone whose dedication, work ethic, and personality make him easy to admire and a joy to be around.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="people" id="brandon">
    <h3>Brandon Emlinger - <em>Groomsman</em></h3>
    <img src="/images/guys/brandon.jpg" src="Brandon Emlinger" />
    <p>Brandon and I have both had the good fortune of being welcomed into the Chen family. I have in him the older brother that I never had, and feel extremely fortunate that he's been there to weather both the good times and the bad with me since I moved to California.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="people" id="geoff">
    <h3>Geoffrey Hamilton - <em>Groomsman</em></h3>
    <img src="/images/guys/geoff.jpg" src="Geoff Hamilton" />
    <p>Throughout our high school careers Geoff and I had opportunities to perform music all over, from Toronto to Florida to Switzerland to Italy.  He has always been as a source of inspiration, especially academically and professionally, and while our paths have diverged since high school I still feel his influence on me today.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="people" id="bryan">
    <h3>Bryan Kelly - <em>Groomsman</em></h3>
    <img src="/images/guys/bryan.jpg" src="Bryan Kelly" />
    <p>As good a brother as anyone could ask for, Bryan has always been there for me.  He consistently motivates me with his desire to improve both mentally and physically as well as his all-around good nature and charisma.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="people" id="mike">
    <h3>Mike Ross - <em>Groomsman</em></h3>
    <img src="/images/guys/mike.jpg" src="Mike Ross" />
    <p>Mike and I were able to navigate our way through music school together.  It is no coincidence that some of the most formative musical and personal experiences of my life took place in his company.  Mike is one of the most creative and original people I know.</p>
